    "### Weekly Questions Roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "### Week 1: Setup & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Are there any missing or irregular timestamps in the dataset? How did you verify consistency?\n",
    "- What is the sampling frequency and are all records spaced consistently?\n",
    "- Did you encounter any duplicates or inconsistent `DateTime` entries?\n",
    "- What daily or weekly patterns are observable in power consumption across the three zones?\n",
    "- Are there seasonal or time-of-day peaks and dips in energy usage?\n",
    "- Which visualizations helped you uncover these patterns?\n",
    "- Which environmental variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation) correlate most with energy usage?\n",
    "- Are any variables inversely correlated with demand in specific zones?\n",
    "- Did your analysis differ across zones? Why might that be?\n",
    "- Did you observe any lagged effects where past weather conditions predict current power usage?\n",
    "- How did you analyze lag (e.g., shifting features, plotting lag correlation)?\n",
    "- What lag intervals appeared most relevant and why?\n",
    "- Did you detect any outliers in the weather or consumption readings?\n",
    "- How did you identify and treat these anomalies?\n",
    "- What might be the impact of retaining or removing them in your model?\n",

    "- What challenges did you face when converting the time-series data into input/output sequences?\n",
    "- How did you handle cases where the lookback window extended beyond the available data?\n",
    "- Which normalization or standardization techniques did you apply to the features, and why?\n",
    "- Did you engineer any cyclical time features (e.g., sine/cosine transforms for hour or day)? How did these impact model performance?\n",
    "- How did you address potential data leakage during scaling or transformation?\n",
    "- How did you split your data into training, validation, and test sets to ensure temporal integrity?\n",
    "- What considerations did you make to prevent information leakage between splits?\n",

    "- Which neural network architecture(s) did you choose for baseline forecasting (e.g., LSTM, GRU, TCN), and what motivated your selection?\n",
    "- How did you structure your input sequences and targets for the chosen model(s)?\n",
    "- What considerations did you make regarding the depth, number of units, and activation functions in your network?\n",
    "- Which loss function and optimizer did you use for training, and why are they suitable for this task?\n",
    "- How did you incorporate regularization techniques such as Dropout or Batch Normalization, and what impact did they have?\n",
    "- What challenges did you encounter during training (e.g., overfitting, vanishing gradients), and how did you address them?\n",
