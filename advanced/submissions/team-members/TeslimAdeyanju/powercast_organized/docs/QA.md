- **Time Gaps**: 0 irregular intervals detected
- **Timestamp Sorting**: Properly sorted in ascending order
- **Expected vs Actual**: Perfect match between expected (52,416) and actual records

The verification process included checking for duplicate timestamps, analyzing sampling intervals, and ensuring proper datetime indexing.

---

**Q: What is the sampling frequency and are all records spaced consistently?**

**A:** The dataset has a consistent 10-minute sampling frequency:

- **Sampling Interval**: 10 minutes (0 days 00:10:00)

### üå¶Ô∏è 3. Environmental Feature Relationships

**Q: Which environmental variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation) correlate most with energy usage?**

**A:** Temperature shows the strongest correlation with energy usage across all zones:

**Correlation Strengths (Strongest to Weakest):**

1. **Temperature**: Strongest positive correlation
   - Zone 3: 0.490 (strongest overall)

**Physical Interpretation:**
- Building thermal mass creates delayed response to temperature changes
- Previous day's weather affects next day's energy planning
- Weekly patterns reflect routine behavior (work schedules, lifestyle patterns)

---

**Q: How did you analyze lag (e.g., shifting features, plotting lag correlation)?**

**A:** We implemented comprehensive lag analysis using our custom `LagAnalyzer`:

**Methodology:**
1. **Lag Correlation Calculation**: Systematically shifted environmental features by 0-72 hours
2. **Cross-Correlation Analysis**: Computed Pearson correlation between lagged features and current power consumption
3. **Autocorrelation Analysis**: Analyzed power consumption's correlation with its own past values (1-168 hour lags)
4. **Visualization**: Created 4-panel plots showing lag effects for each environmental variable

**Technical Implementation:**
- Used pandas `.shift()` method for lag generation
- Calculated correlations for each lag interval
- Plotted correlation coefficients vs lag hours
- Identified optimal lag periods through peak correlation detection

---

**Q: What lag intervals appeared most relevant and why?**

**A:** Several lag intervals showed particular relevance:

**Most Relevant Lag Intervals:**

1. **24-Hour Lag (Daily Cycle)**:
   - Temperature shows strong correlation at 24-hour lag
   - Reflects daily thermal patterns and routine behavior

3. **168-Hour Lag (Weekly Cycle)**:
   - Strong autocorrelation patterns
   - Indicates weekly behavioral routines
   - Work/rest cycle influence

4. **30-40 Hour Lag (Solar Radiation)**:
   - Optimal correlation for solar radiation
   - May reflect delayed heating/cooling responses
   - Building energy storage effects

**Physical Relevance:**
- These intervals correspond to natural cycles (daily, weekly)
- Building thermal inertia creates delayed responses
- Human behavioral patterns create predictable cycles
- Weather persistence effects influence multi-day forecasting

**Extreme Value Analysis:**
- 53 extreme high values detected in each power consumption zone
- No negative power consumption values (data integrity confirmed)
- No physically impossible environmental readings

---

**Q: How did you identify and treat these anomalies?**

**A:** We employed a multi-method outlier detection approach:

**Detection Methods:**
1. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: Q1 - 1.5√óIQR to Q3 + 1.5√óIQR bounds
2. **Z-Score**: |z| > 3 threshold for extreme values
3. **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)**: Robust statistical approach
4. **Domain-Specific Rules**: 
   - Temperature: -10¬∞C to 50¬∞C bounds
   - Humidity: 0% to 100% bounds
   - Power: Non-negative values only

**Treatment Approach:**
- **Conservative Strategy**: Retained most outliers as potentially legitimate extreme values
- **Validation**: Cross-checked outliers across multiple detection methods
- **Documentation**: Detailed logging of outlier patterns and distributions
- **Flagging**: Marked suspicious values for further investigation

**Rationale**: Extreme weather events and high energy demand periods are legitimate phenomena that should be preserved for model training.

---

**Q: What might be the impact of retaining or removing them in your model?**

**A:** The decision to retain or remove outliers has significant modeling implications:

**Impact of Retaining Outliers:**

**Advantages:**
- **Real-World Representation**: Models learn to handle extreme but realistic conditions
- **Robust Predictions**: Better performance during unusual weather events
- **Complete Data**: No loss of information from legitimate extreme events
- **Peak Demand Modeling**: Critical for grid planning and capacity management

**Challenges:**
- **Model Sensitivity**: Potential overfitting to extreme values

- **Improved Average Performance**: Better predictions for typical conditions

**Risks:**
- **Poor Extreme Event Handling**: Model fails during critical peak demand periods
- **Incomplete Learning**: Missing important system behavior patterns
- **Real-World Mismatch**: Production performance degradation during extreme events

**Recommendation:**
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use robust scaling methods (e.g., RobustScaler) that reduce outlier impact without removal
- **Outlier-Robust Loss Functions**: Huber loss or quantile loss for reduced outlier sensitivity
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine models trained with and without outliers
- **Validation Strategy**: Test model performance specifically on extreme value periods

This approach balances robustness with real-world applicability, ensuring the model can handle both typical and extreme operating conditions effectively.
